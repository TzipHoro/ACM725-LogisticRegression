Logistic regression is a useful tool in medical testing because it offers a means of binary classification while also providing insight into the measure of risk associated with each feature variable. 
Odds ratios and marginal effects can be calculated alongside a logistic regression model, which are often easier to interpret than methods like risk difference and risk ratio, as illustrated in section \ref{sec:Results}.
Although the model is able to predict with a high success rate, the analysis did not consider other kinds of generalized linear models that can be used to estimate the associated risk, such as Poisson regression.
Further research is needed to determine the best model to truly understand the association between risk factors and developing heart disease.
