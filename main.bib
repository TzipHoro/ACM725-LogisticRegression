@ARTICLE{Relative-Measures-of-Association-for-Binary-Outcomes,
  title    = "Relative Measures of Association for Binary Outcomes: Challenges
              and Recommendations for the Global Health Researcher",
  author   = "Gallis, John A and Turner, Elizabeth L",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Binary outcomes-which have two distinct levels (e.g.,
              disease yes/no)-are commonly collected in global health research.
              The relative association of an exposure (e.g., a treatment) and
              such an outcome can be quantified using a ratio measure such as a
              risk ratio or an odds ratio. Although the odds ratio is more
              frequently reported than the risk ratio, many researchers,
              policymakers, and the general public frequently interpret it as a
              risk ratio. This is particularly problematic when the outcome is
              common because the magnitude of association is larger on the odds
              ratio scale than the risk ratio scale. Some recently published
              global health studies included misinterpretation of the odds
              ratio, which we hypothesize is because statistical methods for
              risk ratio estimation are not well known in the global health
              research community. OBJECTIVES: To compare and contrast available
              statistical methods to estimate relative measures of association
              for binary outcomes and to provide recommendations regarding
              their use. METHODS: Logistic regression for odds ratios and four
              approaches for risk ratios: two direct regression approaches
              (modified log-Poisson and log-binomial) and two indirect methods
              (standardization and substitution) based on logistic regression.
              FINDINGS: Illustrative examples demonstrate that
              misinterpretation of the odds ratio remains a common issue in
              global health research. Among the four methods presented for
              estimation of risk ratios, the modified log-Poisson approach is
              generally preferred because it has the best numerical performance
              and it is as easy to implement as is logistic regression for odds
              ratio estimation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that, when study
              design allows, studies with binary outcomes should preferably
              report risk ratios to measure relative association.",

@ARTICLE{Log-Odds-and-the-Interpretation-of-Logit-Models,
  title    = "Log Odds and the Interpretation of Logit Models",
  author   = "Norton, Edward C and Dowd, Bryan E",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: We discuss how to interpret coefficients from logit
              models, focusing on the importance of the standard deviation
              ($\sigma$) of the error term to that interpretation. STUDY
              DESIGN: We show how odds ratios are computed, how they depend on
              the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the error term, and their
              sensitivity to different model specifications. We also discuss
              alternatives to odds ratios. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: There is no
              single odds ratio; instead, any estimated odds ratio is
              conditional on the data and the model specification. Odds ratios
              should not be compared across different studies using different
              samples from different populations. Nor should they be compared
              across models with different sets of explanatory variables.
              CONCLUSIONS: To communicate information regarding the effect of
              explanatory variables on binary \{0,1\} dependent variables,
              average marginal effects are generally preferable to odds ratios,
              unless the data are from a case-control study.",

Tables, figures, and charts that should be included to comprehensively assess the results and assumptions to be verified are discussed. This article demonstrates the preferred pattern for the application of logistic methods with an illustration of logistic regression applied to a data set in testing a research hypothesis. Recommendations are also offered for appropriate reporting formats of logistic regression results and the minimum observation-to-predictor ratio. The authors evaluated the use and interpretation of logistic regression presented in 8 articles published in The Journal of Educational Research between 1990 and 2000. They found that all 8 studies met or exceeded recommended criteria.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to study the most important factors affecting diabetes using the logistic regression method and to conduct all tests for this method (Hosmer and Lemeshow test, Omnibus tests of model coefficients, …etc.). The randomized sample included (150) people among the elderly in Al-Hilla city, the research included focusing on (14) independent variables and most of these variables were found to have significance, effect and contribution to the logistic regression - binary response (not sick(0), sick(1)) model are (4) variables (cigarette smoking, exercise, vitamin (D), blood pressure), Which affects diabetes, and the rest of the variables have no significance or effect. The classification of observations using logistic regression-binary response model was accurate, as the overall correct classification rate was (92.7%) while the overall wrong classification rate was (7.3%).},
